-----------------------------------
	(You can find all of this in any bar you created).
	- Names :
		- You can change the name whenever you want and the gameObject will change its name immediately.
		- Its preferred to not leave the name empty.
	- Positioning :
		1.You can change the position by changing the "Position" variable to UpRight/UpLeft/DownRight/DownLeft.
		2.Or you can enable the "Use Advanced Position" and type your own position in "Advanced Position" underneath.
